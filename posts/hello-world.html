            Hello World! That phrase has been typed by countless developers over the many years as they learn new
            programming languages or new technologies. It signifies a birth of something new. Or the start of a new
            journey. Because of this signification is why I decided to use it as the title of my first post on my
            new site. This is a new beginning. The start of a new journey.

            In the back of my mind there was always this voice saying you need to write more. Your career needs to
            get more exposure. I always kept telling that voice that I am fine. My body of work can support me. As I get
            farther into my career I am starting to see the cracks in that thinking. By writing or forcing yourself to
            write about subjects in your industry you force yourself to truly know and understand those subjects. You are
            forced to not make assumptions but to verify your thinking. Verify your experience. This is the goal of my
            articles. I want to force myself to take my knowledge farther.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am forced with deciding what I am going to write about. My day job is in software development operations.
            That is the "natural" fit for me to write but as I wrote above, I want to push my knowledge farther. So yes, I
            write about my experiences on the technical side software enginering and operations. I will also force myself
            to write about the business and administration side of software and operations. It is something that I am
            passionate about and want to grow more in that realm.
