          Magicians practice their craft for years. They continouly hone their skills so their tricks do truly look like
          magic. Audiences watch in wonder and begin to question wether magic does really exist. This is what Operations
          or DevOps is, magic. Well, not really magic but some seem to think what Ops teams do is black magic. They believe
          we sold our soul to Linus Torvalds to gain some dark arts power. In reality we are no different than a software
          engineer or a system administrator. We have just learned to meld the two fields to provide solutions to 
          engineering teams so they ship code efficiently and consistently.

          I get asked a lot by engineers, developers, or people wanting a career change what is involved in DevOps. What
          do you do? The answer is not always straight forward. A lot of what we do depends on the culture of where we work.
          If the company culture is very corporate, we might only work on builds/releases and that's all. If the culture is
          more open, then we might do more that builds and releases. We might create internal tools for the engineers to use
          in their daily work. It just depends.

          Fear not! There are some common tasks that Operations Engineers handle. That is the point of this article. I want
          to cover those areas so people who are thinking of making the transistion into Ops will have a decent understanding
          of what your day will look like.
